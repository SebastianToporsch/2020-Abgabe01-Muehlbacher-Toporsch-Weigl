# Software Configuration Managment Exercise 01

In this exercise we learned how to work with Github and how to effectively commit and push. Especially when it comes to working together on a Java project. At first we distributed the rolls and talked about what classes and subclasses we should implement.
We agreed on the following classes:

## VodkaDrink

### This class should:
- Calculate and return the effect of several vodka drinks on the
human body, given size, weight, gender and duration of intake, assuming that the drinks
were taken in continuously over that duration of time.

#### It has the following sublclasses:
 1. VodkaLongDrink

    Creates a drink that represents a LongDrink containing Vodka.

 2. VodkaShot

    Creates a Shot that is pure Vodka.

## CocktailDrink

### This class should:
- Calculate how many calories a given cocktail contains based on the amount of ingredients it contains.

- Task 2

#### It has the following sublclasses:
 1. PinaColada:

    Creates a Pina Colada with lemonJuice, coconutCream, whippedCream, rum & pineappleJuice.

 2. LongIslandIceTea:

    Creates a Long Island Ice Tea with vodka, tequila, rum, gin, lemonJuice, cola & sugarSyrup
